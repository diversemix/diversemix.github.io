The following post is designed more to be a cheatsheet rather than being read, but hey please read if that's your bag :smile:

## Your shell

Setting up and learning to navigate in your shell is paramount in becoming a productive developer.
### Cheatsheet

DDG (DuckDuckGo) have cheatsheets [see LICENCE](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/LICENSE) and [this one is for bash](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/share/goodie/cheat_sheets/json/bash.json)

Customizing your `.bashrc` file is important to get the most out of your terminal experience. :warning: I need to walk through my [dotfiles](https://github.com/diversemix/dotfiles)

## Scripting

This section has some boiler plate code I use quite frequently.

### variables

Here is a simple example of a script used to backup your home folder (`$HOME`) to a compressed tar file which includes a timestamp in its filename. A useful alternative for a timestamp is `date -Iseconds`, you can change your accuracy to your needs. Its also useful to replace non-alphanumeric characters which can be done with: `date -Iseconds|tr -c '[A-z,0-9]' '-'`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TS=$(date +%Y%m%d)
OF=/var/my-backup-$TS.tgz
tar -cZf $OF $HOME
```

Next up is a little demonstration of how variables have scope - just as in a programming language. See this example of a function defining a locally scoped variable of the same name.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
HELLO=Hello
function hello {
     local HELLO=World
     echo $HELLO
}
echo $HELLO
hello
echo $HELLO
```

### if

If statements (see `man test`) can be executed in a number of ways. In a script it is most common to see it written something like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
T1="foo"
T2="bar"
if [[ "$T1" = "$T2" ]]; then
    echo expression evaluated as true
else
    echo expression evaluated as false
fi
```

> Note the double square brackets are used here, for more information read [this section in the LDP](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/testconstructs.html)

However, conditional branching can be done in a number of ways, for example without the if statement at all:

```bash
[ -f myfile ] && cat myfile || echo "Not found"
```

Or, of course you can use the test command itself:

```bash
test -f myfile && cat myfile || echo "Not found"
```

### for

For loops are very straight forward for command output:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in $( ls ); do
    echo item: $i
done
```
... or a simple sequence:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in `seq 1 100`;
do
    echo $i
done
```

This sort of sequence can be easily constructed in the terminal, for example here to output all the background colors you can use with `tput` :

```bash
for f in `seq 1 256` ; do tput setab $f ; echo -n "  COL:$f  " ; tput sgr0 ; done
```

### loops

Loops are easy enough
```bash
#!/bin/bash
COUNTER=0
while [ $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
    echo The counter is $COUNTER
    let COUNTER=COUNTER+1
done
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash
COUNTER=20
until [ $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
    echo COUNTER $COUNTER
    let COUNTER-=1
done
```

### debug
```bash
#!/bin/bash -x
```

## building

This can can be highly frustrating, but try this command to configure:

```bash
CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ./configure --target=x86
```

## processes
Below is example code to stop processes with a particular name.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TAG=<process-name-group>

how_many() {
    n=`ps aux|grep $TAG|grep -v grep|wc -l`
}

how_many
echo "Found $n processes running."

if [ $n -gt 0 ]
then
        ps aux | grep $TAG | grep -v grep | awk -F ' ' '{ print $2 }'| xargs kill -9
else
        echo "No process running!"
fi

for ((  ; n>0 ; ))
do
        how_many
        echo "Waiting for $n processes to stop..."
        sleep 1
done

```

## curl

Simplest usage:
```bash
curl http://here.com
```
Usage with POST:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "username=test&password=test" http://here.com
```
Additional arguments to get any redirects (HTTP 302):
```bash
 -L -w "Last URL: %{url_effective}"
```
Usage with Cookies, add the following arguments:
```bash
-c cookie.txt -b cookie.txt
```
Parse the output for the TOKEN
```bash
grep csrf cookie.txt|cut -f7
```
Now use this token to format your next request...
```bash
 curl -X POST -c cookie.txt -b cookie.txt -d "username=tesr&password=test&csrfmiddlewaretoken=<<TOKEN_FROM_COOKIE_FILE>>" http://here.com
```
