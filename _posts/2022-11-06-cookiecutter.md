Ways in which you can start a new project, or a scratch playground quicker to impress.

## CookieCutter

https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io

This tools is really great for starting a project from scratch without doing a lot of downloading, installing and plumbing yourself.

> Whilst I do not create my own Cookiecutters (I use a script called `code-in` for getting started quickly). 

There are a number of [cookiecutters on github](https://github.com/search?q=cookiecutter&type=Repositories).
Ones of note:
- [fastapi and react](https://github.com/Buuntu/fastapi-react)
- [python cli](https://github.com/nvie/cookiecutter-python-cli)
- [python package](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)
