Some helpful strategies to help you become a good Technical Lead.

> :warning: Work in Progress

## Create yourself an Event Loop

Create a spreadsheet / Miro board or whatever with the following structure:

| | Daily | Weekly | Monthly |
|---|---|---|---|
| People | :note: | :note: | :note: |
| Delivery | :note: | :note: | :note: |
| Strategy | :note: | :note: | :note: |
| Myself | :note: | :note: | :note: |

Then place in the cells the tasks that need to be performed at each cadence (column) given the topic (row).
