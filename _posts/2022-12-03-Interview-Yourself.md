Here are some questions for your own time to discover more about yourself. Often we can become frustrated or deflated over feeling powerless to change ourselves or our circumstances. Of course, there are many "self-help" exercises. Here are what I would deem the essentials to get back on track, or just to renew and reflect on the goals you currently have...

## 1. The big picture

### A. What do you want to become?

Think or write about the personal qualities of who you want to become. 
Try and make a list as broad as possible rather than in detail then order them by priority.

### B. Antithesis - what you don't want to become?

Do you have any pet hates or areas of your life you really don't like spending time doing? 
Again make a bullet list as broad as possible and try and give them some order.

## 2. Skills & Knowledge

### A. What do you want to learn?

How do you want your skills & knowledge to develop? 
This time try and order them in terms of short, medium and long term.

### B. What have you learned that you don't want to continue with?

What have you already tried in terms of skills, that you don't want to pursue any longer?
This could be because you are no particularly skilled in this area or maybe you just don't like doing it.

## 3. Activities

### A. What things give you energy?

This could be include hobbies as well as parts of your day to day work.

### B. What don't you like about what you have become?

List any bad habits or routines that you need to improve on or that you struggle with.

## 4. People

### A. Social Interactions

How often do you see and interact with
friends, colleagues.
Are these interactions planned, if not how do you want to plan them?

### B. Family Interactions

How often do you see and interact with
Grandparents, parents, siblings, children, grandchildren.
Are these interactions planned, if not how do you want to plan them?

## 5. Career

### A. Career Development

Think about:
- mission security status - order in time horizon

### B. Moonshots

What sort of qualities do you value in the people you admire?
Are there any particular people you do admire?

## 6. Time to write up...

You should have enough information to write a piece about yourself.
Try and not think about it as you now - write in the third-person and see if you agree with what you have written.

Don't forget to include the "Why" as well as the "what". 

## Next...

You might like to now think about the "how" by setting some (goals)[/goals] to help you achieve your aims.
