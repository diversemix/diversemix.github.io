# Welcome

This site has been designed to read more like a book. 
However, the chapters are built to make it easy to read any subject you are most interested in.
The contents can be seen below, ***Happy Reading***

| Chapter | Description |
|---|---|
| [Teams](./team/) | All about building, being in and running teams for technology companies. |
| [Software](./software/) | This chapter is quite varied, also contains information about architecture.|
| [Infrastructure](./infrastructure/) | This chapter is quite varied, also contains information about architecture.|
| [Hardware](./hardware/) | Hardware is more of a hobby or side project for me, so don't go expecting any great pearls of wisdom in here! |


## A little about the Site

This site is built;

- Using ["Github Pages"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and the github repo [can be found here]() out of interest this uses [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
- As clean as possible so it can be maintained with as few tools as possible (in my case git+vim)
