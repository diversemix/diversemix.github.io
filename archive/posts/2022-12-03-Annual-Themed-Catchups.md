If you're involved with weekly catchups either on the receiving end or the mentoring side, then here are some suggestions for structuring them. 
In my experience I have often found that 1-2-1s, catchups or weeklies (however you want to call them), can become stale or even awkward. 
Here are some examples of how you may want to organize catching up with your team members.
